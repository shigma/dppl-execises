# size

Make the evaluation computes the size of a term (3.3.2) instead of reducing the term, and test it on the original test.f.

Hint:

- `pr: string -> unit` prints a string to the screen
- `string_of_int : int -> string` converts an integer into a string
- Remember to change both `.ml` and `.mli` files
